Hi! My name is Jos√© Antonio Zumaquero Torres, but many people found it [TL;DR](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR), so that, people usually call me **Zuma** since I was a child.

I'm proud to consider myself as a _geek_ and a _technology passionate person_, but also I love reading comic books, to enjoy doing sport, dancing, going out with friends, and trying to survive to my playful son's _imagination_.

### More Information

I have some Msc. in Telecommunications Engineering, and I started my carrer as Electronics Engineer, but I have been working as Software Engineer since 2007. During all this time I've worked with many different technologies and many different domains, but I'm currently working as Data Engineer.
